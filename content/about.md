My name is Selwyn and this is my personal blog.

I'm a mostly self taught DevOps Engineer based in Vienna. In my free time I enjoy working on own projects and writing tutorials on tech related topics.

With this blog i hope to share my passion for Open Source technologies and give something back to the community.
