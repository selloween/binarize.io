<h2>> Hello World!<span class="logo__cursor" style="width: 3px; height: 1.625rem;"></span></h2>

I'm Selwyn, a DevOps Engineer based in Vienna.
 
This blog is a nerdy life long learner's diary.
I will provide tutorials on different topics ranging from  DevOps, Sys Engineering, Development, Operating Systems, Hardware and other tech related areas.

I will try my best to be accurate as possible, but there might be errors and room for improvment as technology evolves at the speed of light these days. 

Knowing what you don't know and where to look for it, is the most important skill in the industry. In any case be sure to double check anything you find here or anywhere on the web before going into production.

I hope you find something helpful and feel free to contact me at hello@binarize.io or follow me on Github.
