My name is Selwyn and this is my personal blog. 

I'm a mostly self taught DevOps Engineer based in Vienna. As a former Web Developer I like coding in my free time and writing tutorials on tech related topics and stuff I'm currently learning myself.

With this blog i hope to share my passion for Open Source technologies and give something back to the community.
